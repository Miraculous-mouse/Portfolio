            <h2>Nice to meet you ðŸŽµ I'm Miracle Zhang! </h2>

            <p>I came from Shanghai, China, and I love to speak Shanghainese! I'm currently a sophomore at Cornell University studying in Information Science (UI design & data science), Pschology, and Economics. I'm currently learning web design, ios front-end app development, and design principles. </p>
            <p>I enjoy painting, watching films, and hiking in woods. I refresh my energy by chatting with creative and insightful people, or lying on the slope. I love mice and rats. They are absolutely the cutest on this planet! </p>
           <p>Please free feel to contact me via email: lz284@cornell.edu  I'd love to hear from you if you are interested in working with me or just want to know me!</p>

            <strong class="titles">I love Japanese animations!</strong>
            <p>I enjoy watching various animations & mega with my friends and discussing with them. I'm also a member of Amina club at Cornell. My favorite ones are Attack on Titan, Violet Evergarden, and Fate series! The dreams and advantures in animations are sources of my inspiractions in design and everyday imaginations.</p>

            <strong class="titles">I really love mice, rats, and hamsaters!</strong>
            <p> For me, no sorrow cannot be cured by a video of adorable video of mice! It's super relaxing and rewarding to play with my pet mice after a long day. I'm also involved in cruelty-free products advocacy to spread awareness on reducing and replacing animal testing in cosmetic production. </p>

            <strong class="titles">Here are my artworks!</strong>
            <p>I enjoy painting with different materials and media. I have tried sketching, acrylic painting, wash painting, and even papercut/flower paddles as the color-filling in the artwork. I enjoyed the time fully immersed in art creations, which spared me from concerns or frustrations. The experience is like mediation, when I focus only on the piece in front of me and my imagination, and it often endows me with a new perception of things in life.</p>
