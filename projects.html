                <p class="text">In spring 2022, I attended a hack challenge of designing and building an app within 2 weeks. As a designer, I collborated with front-end and back-end developers to make an app for looking up interesting places and ongoing events at local Ithaca. Our goal is to make life in Ithaca & Cornell more fun and convenient. Below is the logo and video introduction to our app — buckethaca! </p>
