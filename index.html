        <!-- <h2>Work Expectations</h2>
        <div class="text-white">
            <p>I love to work a group of people with shared passions, doing cool projects together. I enjoy the process of collaborating with others to solve tricky problems, devoting our time and efforts, and feeling tired but sincerely fulfilled. Sometimes I would appreciate individual working time before I'm able to share my thoughts. </p>
            <p>As an introvert, I might spend more time getting to know people well, but then I'll form a strong emotional connection with them. I'm also willing to listen, so if any members wish to share their feelings or have a very long day, I'm always here to listen and be a good accompany. And I love to get along with outgoing people, as I feel like there'll always be new experiences, ideas, and adventures when I exchange thoughts with them.
